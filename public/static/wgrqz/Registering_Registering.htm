                  A Representative Office (RO) is an office of a foreign enterprise 
                  that is set up in China to liaise with Chinese businesses and 
                  customers on behalf of the RO's home company. Establishment 
                  of an RO is subject to approval by the relevant authorities 
                  under Chinese law. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Although ROs are not allowed to directly conduct business, there 
                  are still certain benefits that foreign enterprises can gain 
                  from setting up and legally registering a Representative Office. 
                  Perhaps the most important reason is that an RO can help its 
                  home company to generate income from sources inside China. Other 
                  possible benefits of setting up an RO include: ROs can function 
                  as a liaison between the home office and related industries 
                  in China; ROs can conduct market research and do preparatory 
                  work for their home company to possibly directly enter into 
                  the Chinese market. Other benefits include ease of obtaining 
                  Chinese visas for employees, easier direct communications, etc.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  Since China first started allowing the establishment of trading 
                  WFOEs, some foreign enterprises, especially those that conduct 
                  trade with China, have elected to set up a trading WFOE instead 
                  of an RO. From a total business operations standpoint, setting 
                  up a WFOE to directly conduct business in China is much more 
                  efficient than merely having an RO acting as a middleman in 
                  China. We can discuss the options with you to determine which 
                  type of business registration makes the most sense for your 
                  specific situation. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Compared to registering a WFOE, registering an RO is relatively 
                  faster and easier because there are fewer approval authorities 
                  involved and there are fewer documents required. The main benefit 
                  of registering an RO compared with a WFOE is that for an RO, 
                  there is no Registered Capital requirement, whereas a WFOE must 
                  have physically deposited a minimum amount of registered capital 
                  in a Chinese bank (currently RMB100,000; RMB30,000 after January 
                  2006). The total registration fees for an RO are around RMB1000, 
                  which includes carving the RO's company chops (seals). <BR>

                  <STRONG>Requirements for foreign enterprises</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - Foreign enterprises that want to set up a Representative Office 
                  in China must be an officially registered business in its home 
                  country or region. A copy of the official Registration Certificate 
                  issued by the foreign enterprise's home country is required 
                  in order to prove that it is properly registered in its home 
                  country. The Beijing government removed the regulation that 
                  formerly required the home-based business to have been in existence 
                  for no less than one year in April 2004. Now even a foreign 
                  enterprise that is newly registered in its home country can 
                  register an RO in Beijing.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  - A bank reference letter is required from the country or region 
                  where the enterprise headquarters is based. The bank reference 
                  letter should state the name of the foreign enterprise, that 
                  the foreign enterprise has maintained bank accounts with this 
                  particular bank, and that the foreign enterprise is in good 
                  standing with the bank (e.g. no large outstanding debts, etc. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Requirements for the RO</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - A Chief Representative must be designated for the RO. An appointment 
                  letter that specifically designates someone as the RO's chief 
                  representative will be required. The chief representative can 
                  be an expatriate or local Chinese. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - An office site in China is required for the RO. A lease agreement 
                  and the landlord's official documents will be required. The 
                  lease term must be for no less than one year. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Representatives of the RO</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - There must be at least one Chief Representative appointed 
                  for an RO. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - All other foreign employees of the RO can be designated as 
                  "representatives". A formal appointment for each representative 
                  will be required. Expatriates can only be representatives; local 
                  Chinese can either be designated as representatives or as local 
                  employees. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - All expatriate representatives are required to apply for Working 
                  Cards and Work Permits from the relevant authorities. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  - New representatives can be added after the initial RO registration 
                  has been completed. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Lifespan of an RO</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  An RO may register for existence as a legal entity for between 
                  one and ten years, depending on the needs of the foreign enterprise. 
                  (The maximum lifespan was only three years prior to changes 
                  in the law in April 2004.) <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>RO Bank Accounts</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  An RO is allowed to open both a foreign currency account and 
                  an RMB account. The foreign currency account is used for receiving 
                  funds from its parent company in the home country. The RMB account 
                  is used for expenses in China. Normally all money deposited 
                  into the RMB account must come from its foreign currency account 
                  via a bank transfer, i.e. the RMB account cannot receive any 
                  money from any other sources. <BR>

                  <BR>
                  To fully and legally register an RO in China, visits to about 
                  ten different governmental bureaus and agencies are required 
                  and some of them will require numerous visits. A tremendous 
                  amount of complicated paperwork and physical footwork is involved. 
                  Each bureau has its own specialized documents that are required, 
                  and only Chinese language documents or certified translations 
                  are accepted. It could take 4~6 weeks for completion of the 
                  full registration process. Below is a list of the bureaus or 
                  agencies that must be visited during the registration process: 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC)</STRONG>. 
                  The AIC is the first authority to be visited in the registration 
                  process. This authority will issue a Registration Certificate 
                  for the RO and working cards for all representatives. The Registration 
                  Certificate is the most important document that indicates that 
                  your RO is approved and certified by the Chinese government. 
                  To download the documents required by this authority, please 
                  click here… <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Public Security Bureau</STRONG>. This authority will 
                  issue two documents: a PSB Registration Certificate that is 
                  used to apply for visas for the RO's employees; and a Notice 
                  of Chop Carving, which allows the RO's representative to go 
                  to the appointed RO chop-carving shop to obtain the official 
                  company chop. The "chop" is the official company seal that is 
                  used to stamp all official company business documents, much 
                  like a corporate "signature". <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Institute Code Center</STRONG>. Here the RO will obtain 
                  the Code Certificate and the IC Card. The IC Card and the Code 
                  Certificate are very important, similar to a person's ID card 
                  and ID number. They will be used in the following registration 
                  procedures and in the future operations of the RO. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Foreign Currency Bureau</STRONG>. This authority issues 
                  the RO a formal permission notice for use in opening the company's 
                  foreign currency account. The permission notice contains information 
                  about the bank where the RO must open its foreign currency account, 
                  the denomination of the foreign currency that the account will 
                  contain (e.g. USD), usage limitations on the account (only for 
                  receiving overseas funds for ROs), etc. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>State Tax Bureau and local State Tax Office</STRONG>. 
                  This bureau will issue a State Tax Registration Certificate 
                  to the RO. The Local State Tax Office will interview the person 
                  that the RO has designated for handling its tax affairs, check 
                  the nature of the foreign enterprise in order to determine the 
                  tax calculation method to be applied, set a tax payment schedule 
                  and the method of reporting taxes paid, etc. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Local Tax Bureau and Local Tax Office</STRONG>. This 
                  office is similar to the State Tax Bureau and Local State Tax 
                  Office. The only difference is that the State Tax Bureau handles 
                  the Enterprise Income Tax and Business Tax that is levied on 
                  the RO, while the Local Tax Bureau handles the Individual Income 
                  Tax that is levied on employees of the RO. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Bank.</STRONG> The RO can open both a foreign currency 
                  account and an RMB account in the bank suggested by the RO and 
                  subject to be approved by the Foreign Currency Bureau. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Statistics Bureau and Local Statistics office</STRONG>. 
                  This authority issues a Statistics Registration Certificate 
                  to the RO. The Statistics Office will interview the representative 
                  of the RO to give he/she a lesson on the importance of reporting 
                  statistics figures to the office and set up a schedule for reporting 
                  the appropriate statistical figures.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Customs.</STRONG> This authority issues a Customs Registration 
                  Certificate to the RO. The Certificate will be used when employees 
                  of the RO have personal belongings, office equipment, samples 
                  for exhibitions, samples of goods from overseas, etc. that need 
                  to go through Chinese Customs. If the RO has none of these items, 
                  this step can be deleted.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Because the scope of business is crucially important in the 
                  WFOE business registration application, Beijing Yafei always 
                  confers with the appropriate officials to ensure that every 
                  business activity that is listed on the registration application 
                  is an approved business activity and that every business activity 
                  is designed as broadly as allowable so that clients can be more 
                  flexible in what activities they are allowed to conduct. We 
                  will not submit an application until we are assured that the 
                  application information follows the pertinent rules and regulations 
                  and that it will allow our clients to achieve the maximum benefits 
                  of running their businesses in China.<BR>

                  Whether your RO is subject to paying taxes and what taxes will 
                  be applied will depend on the nature of the "Foreign Enterprise". 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  ROs of foreign governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, 
                  and agencies of certain international organizations such as 
                  the U.N. are non-taxable, but this is subject to the approval 
                  of the China Tax Bureaus. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  ROs of foreign law firms, accounting firms and auditing firms 
                  are subject to paying the Enterprise Income Tax (EIT), the Business 
                  Tax (BT), and the Individual Income Tax (IIT) for their employees. 
                  The EIT and BT will be determined according to the contractual 
                  income generated by the ROs through the providing of consulting 
                  services in China on behalf of their parent firms.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  ROs of foreign enterprises engaging in trading, advertising, 
                  tourism, etc., are also subject to paying EIT, BT, and IIT. 
                  The EIT and BT will be determined by the operational expenses 
                  of the RO. Roughly speaking, EIT and BT together total nearly 
                  10% of the total amount of the RO's expenses. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  For foreign enterprises that do not fit into any of the above 
                  categories, EIT and BT will be levied only when the ROs assist 
                  their parent companies in earning income from sources inside 
                  China; otherwise they are free of EIT and BT. IIT will be levied 
                  the same as on the other types of foreign enterprises. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Among the different methods of computing EIT and BT, the method 
                  that determines taxes based on total expenses could be the most 
                  expensive method. If the RO cannot provide the proper documents 
                  that indicate the true nature of its parent office (law firm, 
                  advertising company, etc.), the computation method will most 
                  likely be determined by the tax officials. We assist our clients 
                  in proper registration with the tax bureaus, but even more importantly 
                  we help our clients to negotiate with the tax officials to get 
                  the best possible treatment on the applicable taxation method 
                  imposed on our clients. For more details on your specific business 
                  situation, please contact us. <BR>

                  For the RO to employ expatriate representatives that can legally 
                  work and reside in China, in addition to the Working Card that 
                  will be obtained during the registration process, the expatriate 
                  representatives will also be required to obtain a Work Permit 
                  and a Residence Permit. Expatriate representatives from Taiwan, 
                  Hong Kong and Macau will only require a Work Permit; foreign 
                  representatives will also require a Residence Permit. </P>
                <P>Both Work Permits and Residence Permits are normally good for 
                  one year, and can be renewed by submitting the appropriate documents 
                  to the Labor Bureaus and Public Security Bureaus respectively. 
                </P>
                <P>Residence permits also function as multiple-entry visas, which 
                  are very useful for those expatriate representatives who need 
                  to travel in and out of China frequently. </P>
                <P>An RO may also have foreign clients that wish to visit their 
                  office in China. An RO is allowed to issue Invitation Letters 
                  that will allow their clients to obtain Chinese business (F) 
                  visas so that they may legally enter China. </P>
                <P>Our company assists in obtaining these working documents for 
                  your expatriate representatives and we can also help with obtaining 
                  official invitation letters for your guests. For details, please

      id=ro-changing name=ro-changing></A>Changing the Registration of an RO</STRONG></FONT><BR>
                  <BR>
                  In the event that certain changes are necessary for the RO, 
                  for example, office relocation, the appointment of a different 
                  Chief Representative, the addition of new representatives, etc., 
                  the RO will need to go through the proper formalities with all 
                  of the same authorities that were involved in the original RO 
                  registration process. The RO will have to return all of the 
                  original certificates and documents that were issued before 
                  the authorities will issue the new certificates and documents. 
                </P>
                <P>Changing the Chief Representative can be problematic so special 
                  attention must be paid to always keeping the proper records 
                  and documentation for the Chief Representative and tax payments. 
                  Under the regulations, to change the Chief Representative, the 
                  RO must first present all documents showing that the current 
                  Chief Representative has paid his/her IIT for the previous three 
                  years. If any of the required documents are missing, the RO 
                  could be forced to re-pay the taxes or pay a fine. This is just 
                  one example of why it is crucial that the RO maintain proper 
                  management and filing of its business documents. </P>
                <P>Changing the official office address may become another problem 
                  in some situations. The problem often originates with the legality 
                  of the new office site location. It is very important that RO 
                  representatives do not sign a lease with a landlord (both those 
                  that manage office buildings and those that own an apartment) 
                  if the landlord cannot provide the official property ownership 
                  certificate for the building. For some newly built office buildings 
                  or apartment buildings, the landlord may not yet have the property 
                  ownership certificate; in this case it may be acceptable if 
                  they can provide relevant documents that prove that the office 
                  site in question is truly their property and that they are merely 
                  waiting to receive their official certificate. The RO representative 
                  must be able to determine whether the landlord’s documents will 
                  be able to be used to register the new office location with 
                  the proper authorities. Our office can assist you with ensuring 
                  that the landlord’s documents are legal for the re-registration 
                  process, as well as any other problems that may be associated 
                  with changing the RO’s registration. Please contact us for more 
                  detailed information.</P>
