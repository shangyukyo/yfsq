                  The Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WFOE) is one possible business 
                  structure that can be used by foreign investors to register 
                  and license a business in China. The WFOE is a limited liability 
                  company (liability is limited to the amount of the registered 
                  capital) that is 100% owned by foreign investors. WFOEs were 
                  originally conceived to encourage manufacturing activities that 
                  were either oriented towards exporting products or that introduced 
                  advanced technology into China. However, with China's entry 
                  into the WTO, these conditions were gradually abolished and 
                  the WOFE is increasingly being used for service providers such 
                  as a variety of consulting and management services, software 
                  development, trading enterprises, etc.<BR>

                  <BR>
                  The WFOE is becoming the most popular business structure used 
                  by foreign investors. Some of the advantages of establishing 
                  a WFOE include: <BR>
                  - Independence and freedom to implement the worldwide strategies 
                  of the parent company without having to consider the involvement 
                  of a local Chinese partner. This is the main reason that most 
                  companies choose the WFOE business structure. <BR>
                  - The ability to formally and legally conduct business inside 
                  China rather than simply functioning as a Representative Office 
                  (RO), including the capability of issuing legal receipts/invoices 
                  to customers in local Chinese currency (RMB) and also the ability 
                  to receive revenue in RMB. This benefit also applies to other 
                  Foreign Investment Structures (JVs, foreign invested holding 
                  companies, etc.) with the exception of ROs. <BR>
                  - The capability for converting profits and revenues received 
                  in local Chinese currency (RMB) to other currencies such as 
                  U.S. dollars, British pounds, Eurodollars, etc. <BR>
                  - Protection of intellectual know-how and technology <BR>
                  - Greater efficiency in operations, management and future development.

                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>- Business Scope</STRONG><BR>
                  <BR>
                  The business scope is narrowly defined and interpreted for all 
                  businesses in China; a WFOE may only legally conduct business 
                  within the business scope that appears on its business license. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  In the application documents, the business scope is written 
                  as a list of business activities that the WFOE will conduct 
                  in China, and the first business activity will define the overall 
                  nature of the WFOE for classification purposes. The classification 
                  will further define the minimum required capital, type of invoices, 
                  type of applicable taxes, etc. As one example, for a previous 
                  WFOE registration, the company's business scope was written 
                  as "retail of cosmetic products, training on cosmetic products, 
                  after-sales services." The nature of this WFOE was therefore 
                  defined by the Chinese authorities as a "retail-trading WFOE", 
                  thus the required registered capital was RMB300,000, and it 
                  was able to receive the Value-Added-Tax invoices that are essential 
                  to a trading company in China.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  Because the scope of business is crucially important in the 
                  WFOE business registration application, Beijing Yafei always 
                  confers with the appropriate officials to ensure that every 
                  business activity that is listed on the registration application 
                  is an approved business activity and that every business activity 
                  is designed as broadly as allowable so that clients can be more 
                  flexible in what activities they are allowed to conduct. We 
                  will not submit an application until we are assured that the 
                  application information follows the pertinent rules and regulations 
                  and that it will allow our clients to achieve the maximum benefits 
                  of running their businesses in China.<BR>

                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>- Registered Capital and Total Investment Quota </STRONG><BR>
                  <BR>
                  Registered Capital and Total Investment Quota are two important 
                  types of capital that the Chinese government officials will 
                  check to ensure that both are listed correctly. The amounts 
                  for both types of capital will appear on the Approval Certificate 
                  and Business License. For the WFOE, the minimum amount of Registered 
                  Capital required is RMB100,000; however, a recently enacted 
                  law will decrease this amount to RMB30,000 as of January 2006 
                  to encourage more small businesses by lowering the minimum investment 
                  fund requirements for Registered Capital. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Registered Capital</STRONG> is the amount of funds that 
                  the Chinese government requires of foreign investors to contribute 
                  to their projects in China (e.g. WFOEs). The Chinese government 
                  sets requirements for the minimum amount of registered capital 
                  to start a business. Registered Capital must be of an amount 
                  greater than the minimum requirement of the China Company Law 
                  (currently RMB100,000, RMB30,000 after January 2006.) The Registered 
                  Capital can only come from the foreign investors, and must be 
                  actually paid into the company bank account then verified by 
                  an independent certified accounting agency in China. The amount 
                  of registered capital can be increased but official procedures 
                  will be required. Registered Capital must be no less than 70% 
                  of the Total Investment Quota; however, the ratio may be decreased 
                  when the amount of Registered Capital exceeds US$ 3 million. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The actual amount of Registered Capital required is subject 
                  to the final approval of the approval authority. The Chinese 
                  officials have the right to require a business to increase the 
                  amount of Registered Capital if they deem the minimum Registered 
                  Capital amount as insufficient for the requirements of the startup 
                  business according to the project description as written in 
                  the application documents. The final amount of Registered Capital 
                  required is sometimes a result of negotiations with the appropriate 
                  officials during the registration period. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Total Investment Quota</STRONG> is the total amount 
                  of funds that will be invested in the WFOE during its entire 
                  planned period of operation. The Total Investment Quota must 
                  be greater than or equal to the Registered Capital. Unlike Registered 
                  Capital, which has to be fully paid into the WFOE's Chinese 
                  bank account before starting business operations, the Total 
                  Investment Quota is the total amount of funds planned to be 
                  contributed to the project over its lifespan and it does not 
                  necessarily have to be fully deposited in the bank. The excess 
                  amount of the Total Investment Quota over the Registered Capital 
                  can come from sources other than the foreign investors listed 
                  in the Articles of Association of the WFOE; for example, it 
                  can be borrowed from banks or other sources either inside China 
                  or from overseas. This amount can be increased but any additional 
                  amounts of Total Investment Capital must be approved by the 
                  relevant Chinese authorities. <BR>

                  Of the long list of documents that are required for business 
                  registration, there are two documents that are very important 
                  and could make the difference in whether or not the WFOE registration 
                  application process goes smoothly. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Articles of Association</STRONG> is one of the most 
                  important documents in the registration process. The Articles 
                  of Association define the rules and principles for the entire 
                  operation of the WFOE. It contains such information as Business 
                  Scope, the amount of Registered Capital and Total Investment 
                  Quota, Management Structure (which defines the highest authority 
                  in the WFOE, either a Board of Directors or a General Manager), 
                  policies and rules on accounting, taxation, profit division, 
                  employment, conditions on termination and liquidation, etc. 
                  There is no universal sample for an appropriate Articles of 
                  Association; each different approval authority may have its 
                  own ideas of what is acceptable. The WFOE representative can 
                  consult the appropriate authorities for a sample Articles of 
                  Association as a guideline in writing the Articles of Association. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Feasibility Study Report</STRONG> is another of the 
                  two most important documents for registration. In this report, 
                  the entire WFOE project must be described, explaining each business 
                  activity that it will conduct in China, demonstrating that all 
                  activities follow Chinese regulations and that the entire project 
                  is feasible both technically and financially. For some small 
                  consulting WFOEs for example, a 3 to 4 page Feasibility Study 
                  Report would be sufficient, while for large projects such as 
                  manufacturing WFOEs, a proper Feasibility Study Report may consist 
                  of dozens of pages. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Writing good Articles of Association and Feasibility Study Reports 
                  can guarantee at least a 50% chance for approval from the Chinese 
                  government. Yafei provides expert consulting services on 
                  the proper completion of these documents. Yafei has also 
                  built up an extensive bank of document samples for various WFOEs;

                  <BR>
                  To fully and legally register a business in China, you will 
                  be required to visit at least ten different governmental bureaus 
                  and agencies; some of them will require numerous visits. A tremendous 
                  amount of complicated paperwork and physical footwork is involved. 
                  Each bureau has its own specialized documents that are required, 
                  and only Chinese language documents or translations are accepted. 
                  After you have chosen an office site and have signed a lease 
                  agreement, you are ready to dive into the registration procedures. 
                  The entire process can be roughly divided into four steps. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Step One: Pre-registration of the WFOE name</STRONG> 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  To register a name for your WFOE, you will need to know the 
                  regulations for naming the business. The legal name of a WFOE 
                  consists of four words presented as: <BR>
                  Location (City) + business name + main business activity + structure. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  For example: Beijing + ABC + Management Consulting + Co., Ltd 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  In the example, "ABC" is the Chinese translation of the foreign 
                  business name of the foreign investor; the translation can be 
                  made either by sound or meaning. For example, "Mai Dang Lao" 
                  is the translation of "McDonald's" by sound (the Chinese version 
                  sounds similar to the English pronunciation); "Wei Ruan" is 
                  the translation of "Microsoft" by meaning (it means the same 
                  thing in Chinese as "Microsoft" does in English). "Management 
                  Consulting" is the main business activity of the example WFOE. 
                  "Co., Ltd." is the legal structure of WFOEs. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  A basic rule in naming a WFOE is that it can only register "ABC" 
                  as its business name when it has not already been registered 
                  by any other business in China. In practice, due to the vast 
                  number of businesses that have already been registered and thus 
                  a high chance of conflict, it is a good idea for a WFOE to work 
                  out a couple of options for the business name before going to 
                  the AIC for registration. Only the Chinese name of the WFOE 
                  can to be registered. An English name for a WFOE is allowed, 
                  but it is not officially recognized and the registration of 
                  English business names is not allowed, although the business 
                  can apply for trademark protection for its English name in China.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Step Two: Apply for the WFOE Approval Certificate</STRONG> 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  After obtaining the WFOE name and completing the application 
                  documents, the WFOE representative can then go to the competent 
                  approval authorities for the Approval Certificate. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Identifying competent approval authorities is sometimes difficult, 
                  especially when the WFOE business covers activities that are 
                  deemed "restricted" as listed in the "Guide for Foreign Investment". 
                  The WFOE representative will need to have sound knowledge on 
                  the structure of Chinese government departments and their functions. 
                  Generally, the local commerce bureaus are the right places for 
                  the WFOE representative to visit. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Every approval authority publishes its "standard processing 
                  time", e.g., 10 working days, 30 working days, etc. They can 
                  issue the WFOE Approval Certificate within the stated processing 
                  time if the application documents that are submitted are complete 
                  and everything is in order. But in practice, the WFOE representative 
                  will probably face inquiries about the amount of registered 
                  capital, business scope, and other "hot" checking points. Officials 
                  have the right to require the WFOE to provide more supporting 
                  documents or to allow the amendment of the application documents, 
                  but if this happens, they will start all over and the processing 
                  time will be longer than the one that was published. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Our experience has been that friendly discussions and negotiations 
                  with officials within the approval authority are the keys to 
                  success in this step. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Once issued, the Approval Certificate contains information such 
                  as the WFOE's name, the address of the WFOE's main office site, 
                  Business Scope, Registered Capital, Total Investment Quota, 
                  Foreign Investors, and Terms of Business Operation, etc. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Once the WFOE receives the Approval Certificate, Step Three 
                  can be addressed. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Step Three: Apply for the WFOE's Business License</STRONG> 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  With the Approval Certificate and other required documents, 
                  the WFOE representative can go to the local Administration for 
                  Industry and Commerce (AIC) to apply for the Business License. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  This step is relatively easier than the previous one because 
                  there is much less paperwork involved and a much shorter processing 
                  time. The standard processing time for Beijing's AIC is 5 working 
                  days. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The AIC charges a registration fee of 0.08% of the Registered 
                  Capital. For example, if the WFOE's Registered Capital is US$ 
                  1 million, you will need to pay US$ 800 as the registration 
                  fee. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The AIC will issue the WFOE with two kinds of Business Licenses. 
                  Before the Registered Capital is fully paid into the Chinese 
                  bank and certified by an independent accounting agency, the 
                  WFOE will only receive a Temporary Business License. The Formal 
                  Business License will be issued only after the Registered Capital 
                  has been deposited and certified by the accounting agency. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Once the Temporary Business License has been received, the WFOE 
                  is officially established as a legal entity and can legally 
                  conduct business. The Temporary Business License also allows 
                  the WFOE representative to continue on with the remaining registration 
                  steps, open a bank account, etc. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>Step Four: Post-registration Activities </STRONG><BR>
                  <BR>
                  After the WFOE has received the Temporary Business License, 
                  it will need to be registered with a dozen bureaus and their 
                  local offices. The WFOE will need to have its "chops" carved 
                  and open bank accounts. Each bureau has its own specific list 
                  of documents that will be required. The processing time for 
                  Step Four varies from 1~10 working days. Overall, the WFOE will 
                  need 4-5 weeks to complete these post registration activities. 
                  Some key points of Step Four are: <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>- Registration with tax bureaus and reporting to local 
                  tax offices:</STRONG><BR>
                  <BR>
                  The WFOE will need to register with two local Tax bureaus: the 
                  State Tax Bureau and the Local Tax Bureau. These bureaus will 
                  issue the Tax Registration Certificates that the WFOE will present 
                  to the bank when opening bank accounts. These certificates will 
                  also used for purchasing official invoices, which are essential 
                  documents for doing business in China. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  In addition to registering with the tax bureaus, the WFOE will 
                  need to report to their local tax offices. There are two tax 
                  offices that require WFOE to visit, one has authority over Local 
                  Tax, the other has authority over State Tax. The local tax offices 
                  will assign tax officers who will set tax filing schedules and 
                  determine a tax filing method (mostly likely online at present) 
                  for the WFOE. The WFOE will receive an account number and password 
                  for online tax filing and receive the appropriate type of invoices 
                  to provide its clients when providing services or goods. Finally, 
                  the tax officers may also recommend the specific machine models 
                  that will be needed for printing invoices. It is suggested that 
                  the WFOE send its (future) accountant for reporting to the local 
                  tax offices.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>- Opening of bank accounts </STRONG><BR>
                  <BR>
                  A WFOE is allowed to open at least one RMB account and one foreign 
                  currency account, depending on the number of and the nationalities 
                  of the foreign investors. The WFOE can choose a bank branch 
                  for opening the foreign currency accounts but the branch bank 
                  must be approved by the local Foreign Exchange Bureaus. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The main foreign currency account is used for receiving registered 
                  capital from foreign investors. Total injected funds cannot 
                  exceed the Total Investment Quota that is set for the WFOE in 
                  the registration application. Repatriating the Registered Capital 
                  to home countries is forbidden during the term of business operation. 
                  <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The WFOE can open another foreign currency account for use in 
                  business operations. This is subject to approval by local the 
                  Foreign Exchange Bureaus. For detailed information please contact 
                  us. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The RMB accounts are used for expenses and other business operation 
                  uses in China. The money going into the RMB accounts can come 
                  from its foreign currency accounts via a bank transfer, or from 
                  the income the WFOE receives from doing business in China.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>- Registering the WFOE's expatriate employees with the 
                  Labor Bureau</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Expatriate employees who will work full-time for more than six 
                  months in the WFOE will need to be registered with the Beijing 
                  Labor Bureaus to receive a Work Permit for each of them. Foreign 
                  employees will also need to get a Residence Permit from the 
                  local Public Security Bureau. With a Work Permit and a Residence 
                  Permit, the WFOE's foreign employees can legally work and reside 
                  in China. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  As of October 2005, expatriate employees from Taiwan, Hong Kong 
                  and Macau are required to join China's "Social Security System" 
                  which basically requires employers to pay unemployment insurance, 
                  health insurance and accidental injury insurance, as well as 
                  into pension funds housing funds and education funds for these 
                  employees. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  <STRONG>- Chops</STRONG> <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Chops are commonly used in official documents such as contracts, 
                  application forms, checks, etc. It is mandatory for a WFOE to 
                  have a Company Chop carved and a Finance Chop carved. Personal 
                  Name stamps are optional. <BR>

                  To carve (make) chops, the WFOE will need to design samples 
                  of its desired company chops and present them to the Public 
                  Security Bureau (PSB) for approval. The PSB will appoint a chop 
                  shop for you to make the chops once the designs have been approved.

                  <BR>
                  The Company Chop is used as on any company documentation as 
                  a mark of authenticity to prove that it did indeed come from 
                  that particular company. The Finance Chop will be mainly used 
                  to make bank checks and other financial documents valid with 
                  the chop acting much like a company's "signature". <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The Finance Chop is not enough to make a check valid; the check 
                  will also have to be "chopped" with the Personal Name Chop. 
                  Another option for validating checks is to use both the Finance 
                  Chop and an authorized employee's handwritten signature. <BR>

                  The WFOE representative will also need to visit even more authorities 
                  to complete the WFOE registration. These other authorities include 
                  the local Technology Supervision Bureau, Statistics Bureau, 
                  Finance Bureau, and the local AIC office. Each of them set a 
                  specific deadline for the WFOE to register with them; usually 
                  all of them require registration within 30 days of receiving 
                  the Temporary Business License. Missing the deadlines or failing 
                  to register with any of them could result in fines for the WFOE.

                <P>Compared to registering a business in most Western countries, 
                  registering a business in China is challenging work filled with 
                  paperwork and bureaucratic red tape. It is practically impossible 
                  to properly complete the registration process without a qualified 
                  agency. Be sure that the agency is certified by the Beijing 
                  AIC, that the agency has good connections and relationships 
                  with the various local authorities, and that they possess comprehensive 
                  knowledge about the numerous important aspects involved with 
                  legally and properly registering a WFOE. Please contact us for 
                  professional and honest registration services at reasonable 
                  prices.</P>
